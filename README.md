Foundational courses for Generative AI should cover essential concepts:

1. [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?): This series of courses covers the basics of neural networks, sequence models, and practical aspects of deep learning. It's an excellent starting point before diving into generative models.

1. [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition by Stanford University](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/): While not solely focused on generative models, this course provides a deep understanding of neural networks and their applications, which is essential for understanding generative models. Need to do some more digging if this course is available for free.

1. [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans): Offered by DeepLearning.AI, this specialization focuses specifically on GANs, covering their architecture, training techniques, and applications.


1. [Creative Applications of Deep Learning with TensorFlow on Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/creative-applications-of-deep-learning-with-tensorflow-i/info): This course explores creative applications of deep learning, including generative models for art and music, providing a practical perspective on generative AI.

1. [Natural Language Processing Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing): Many generative AI applications involve natural language generation. This specialization covers relevant topics like sequence-to-sequence models and language generation.

1. [Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science?)

1. Online Tutorials and Papers: Stay updated with recent research papers on platforms like arXiv and tutorials on platforms like GitHub and Medium for practical implementations and cutting-edge advancements.
